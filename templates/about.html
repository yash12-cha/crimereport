  Crime is a part of illegal activities in human life. It is quite obvious that the rate of crimes is increasing day by day in all societies across the world, but we do believe that there is a lot which can be done by both the governments and the individuals to reduce the crimes in communities. The rise of population and complex society rises the range of anti-social conducts that must be restricted by the government through the military and different organizations particularly the Police Force. There are many current crime management systems which faces several difficulties, as there is no means to report crime instantly other than phone calls, messaging or face-to-face compliant filing. Hence, "Crime Report" has proposed an online crime reporting system which allows the user to file crime complaints.This system helps the users take an advantage of reporting any complaint from anywhere bringing the whole system online.
